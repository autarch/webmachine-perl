This is a port of [Webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine),
actually it is closer to
[the ruby version](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby), with
a little bit of [the javascript version](https://github.com/tautologistics/nodemachine)
thrown in for good measure.

It runs atop the [Plack](https://www.metacpan.org/module/Plack) but since it
really handles the whole HTTP transaction, it is not appropriate to use
most middleware modules. (NOTE: I will write more about this in the future.)

## Getting Started

This module is extremely young and it is a port of an extremely young module in
another language (ruby), which itself is a port of a fairly young module in yet
another language (erlang). But that all said, it really seems like a sane idea
and so I stole it and ported it to Perl.

NOTE: More details to come, but for now, this is all.
